## Hungry Squirrel App

In this game, a Squirrel is in a maze looking for nuts. The user guides the squirrel to find and eat the nuts. Two types of nuts are available in the maze: Almonds and Peanuts. The squirrel gains nutritional points as it finds and eats the nuts. Once it finds all the nuts in the maze, the game is over. 8 classes and 1 interface are defined: Maze class, Entity class, Squirrel class, Wall class, Nut class, Almond class, Peanut class, Movable interface and HungrySquirrelGame class.

The maze is a 20 x 50 matrix represented by a 2-dimensional Entity array. Walls in the maze are represented by ‘*’ and empty positions by blank spaces. The maze is read from a text file “Maze.txt”.
Nuts types and locations are random.
There are poisonous cashews.

Let's play!
